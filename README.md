# ObjectDetectorAndroidJava

One of the exciting feature announced by Android is TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

App gets the current frames from the camera and it uses this frame to get predictions using the SSD-Mobilenet model trained using the Tensorflow Object Detection API.


A device running Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher is required to run the demo due to the use of the camera2 API, although the native libraries themselves can run on API >= 14 devices.
